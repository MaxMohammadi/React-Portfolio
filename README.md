# Portfolio Markdown Blog

This will be a section of my portfolio page, in the form of a tab. This will also be shown as a project in my projects dashboard.

# React Example

This directory is a brief example of a [React](https://reactjs.org/) app with [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction) that can be deployed with Vercel and zero configuration.

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own React project, along with Serverless Functions, with Vercel.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/import/project?template=https://github.com/vercel/vercel/tree/main/examples/create-react-app-functions)

_Live Example: https://create-react-app.now-examples.now.sh/_

### How We Created This Example

To get started with React, along with [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction), with Vercel, you can use the [Create-React-App CLI](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ npx create-react-app my-app
```
